# Haruna
Haruna is a project dedicated to designing the microarchitecture of an RV64IMAC microprocessor utilizing the powerful vector extension of RISC-V. Our initial objective is to develop a softcore implementation, offering a versatile and scalable platform for high-performance computing applications. Once the concept is validated, we plan to transition to a hard processor design.
